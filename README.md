// User Stories To Get To MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

<b>AS A USER I CAN</b><br>
// Register a new user account with the system (must be secured with a password)<br>
// Login with my existing credentials<br>
// Create at least one account<br>
// Deposit funds into an account (use doubles, not ints)<br>
// Withdraw funds from an account (no overdrafting!)<br>
// View the balance of my account(s) (all balance displays must be in proper currency format) <br>

<b>MINIMUM FEATURES</b><br>

All exceptions are properly caught and handled.<br>
Proper use of OOP principles.<br>
Documentation (all classes and methods have basic documentation).<br>

Logging messages and exceptions to a file using a custom logger.<br>
